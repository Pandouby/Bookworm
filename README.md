# Bookworm

Bookworm is designed as an app that allows users to easily add and keep track of the books they own and have read. Users can assign ratings, record notes, and capture thoughts about specific books. Books can be added conveniently by scanning their barcodes. The platform’s core idea is to analyze user ratings and provide recommendations for similar books that align with those the user has rated positively, using a multidimensional embedding space.
